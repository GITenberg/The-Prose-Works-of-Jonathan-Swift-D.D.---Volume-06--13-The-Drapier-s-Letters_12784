description: "Drapier's Letters is the collective name for a series of seven pamphlets\
  \ written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin,\
  \ Jonathan Swift, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against the imposition of\
  \ a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of inferior quality.\
  \ William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing\
  \ of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally\
  \ and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since the subject\
  \ was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to\
  \ hide from retaliation.\nAlthough the letters were condemned by the Irish government,\
  \ with prompting from the British government, they were still able to inspire popular\
  \ sentiment against Wood and his patent. The popular sentiment turned into a nationwide\
  \ boycott, which forced the patent to be withdrawn; Swift was later honoured for\
  \ this service to the people of Ireland. Many Irish people recognised Swift as a\
  \ hero for his defiance of British control over the Irish nation. Beyond being a\
  \ hero, many critics have seen Swift, through the persona of the Drapier, as the\
  \ first to organise a \"more universal Irish community\", although it is disputed\
  \ as to who constitutes that community. Regardless of whom Swift is actually appealing\
  \ to or what he may or may not have done, the nickname provided by Archbishop King,\
  \ \"Our Irish Copper-Farthen Dean\", and his connection to ending the controversy\
  \ stuck.\nThe first complete collection of the Drapier's Letters appeared in the\
  \ 1734 George Faulkner edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift along with an allegorical\
  \ frontispiece offering praise and thanks from the Irish people. Today, the Drapier's\
  \ Letters are an important part of Swift's political writings, along with Gulliver's\
  \ Travels (1726), A Tale of a Tub (1704), and A Modest Proposal (1729).\n From Wikipedia\
